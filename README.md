# Chatbot with React and styled-components

A simple yet interactive chatbot application built with React and styled-components. This project implements a conversational interface where a chatbot named **Alice** interacts with users through a variety of prompts, based on a stateful response system. The chatbot is designed to simulate natural conversation, offering responses for topics such as weather, mood, jokes, facts, music, movies, and more.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A user-friendly interface for seamless conversation.
- **Dynamic Responses**: The chatbot generates responses based on user input using multiple conditional branches.
- **Stateful Conversation**: Maintains context through conversation state, allowing personalized follow-ups.
- **Auto-Scroll Chat Area**: Automatically scrolls to the latest message, ensuring a smooth chat experience.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Saves chat history in the browser’s local storage so your conversation is maintained even after a refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed with `styled-components` to adapt to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **styled-components**: For writing scoped and dynamic CSS.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic of the chatbot.
- **Local Storage**: For storing chat history locally.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-react.git
   cd chatbot-react
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- **Starting a Conversation**: Simply type your message in the input field and press **Send**. Alice will respond based on keywords in your message.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Alice’s responses vary depending on your input. For example:
  - Greetings like "good", "great", or "fine" prompt Alice to ask what made your day good.
  - Keywords such as "weather", "joke", "fact", etc., trigger specific responses.
  - Additional keywords for topics like music, movies, food, sports, travel, books, and technology generate tailored responses.
- **Persisted Chat History**: Your conversation is saved locally, so you can revisit your chat even after refreshing the page.

## Project Structure

```
/src
  ├── App.js             // Main application component with chat logic and state management
  ├── components/        // Contains reusable components
  │      ├── ChatAreaComponent.js  // Displays chat messages with auto-scroll functionality
  │      ├── Message.js            // Message bubble component
  │      └── MessageInput.js       // Input component for user messages
  ├── styles/            // Contains styled-components for layout and design
  └── index.js           // Entry point for the React application
```

*Note:* This is a simplified overview. As the project grows, you may refactor components and structure the folders accordingly.

## Customization

- **Extending Chatbot Responses**: Modify the `getResponse` function in `App.js` to add more `else if` conditions for different conversation topics or keywords.
- **Styling Adjustments**: Change the CSS within your styled-components to adjust colors, layout, or typography.
- **State Management Enhancements**: For larger applications, consider integrating state management libraries like Redux or Context API.
